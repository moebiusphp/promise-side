Testing resolutions
Promise result OK: true
Promise result OK: false
Promise result OK: null

Testing rejections
Promise rejection OK: true
Promise rejection OK: false
Promise rejection OK: null

Testing chained promises:
 1. Resolved with reason "Starting to resolve them"
 2. Resolved with reason "First one done."
 3. Resolved with reason "Second one done."
 4. Final one with reason "Third one done."
Finally we have this result from a promise returned in the last one: "This came from a returned promise"
